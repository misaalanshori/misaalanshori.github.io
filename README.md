## Making my own website
The plan is to use NextJS to do a static site generation on Github Actions and then deploy it to Github Pages. Also, by setting the Github Action to run on a schedule we can make the website "semi-dynamic" without an actual backend. So far from what I understand, the Github Actions free limitations is actually very generous, so i think its possible to rebuild the site every couple minutes (maybe every 15 minutes). Though for now its unnecessary to do it that fast, as the data used probably only updates once a day.
