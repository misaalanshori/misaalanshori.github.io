## Making my own website
The plan is to use NextJS to do a static site generation on Github Actions and then deploy it to Github Pages. Also, by setting the Github Action to run on a schedule we can make the website "semi-dynamic" without an actual backend. So far from what I understand, the Github Actions free limitations is actually very generous, so i think its possible to rebuild the site every couple minutes (maybe every 5-15 minutes). Though for now its unnecessary as we don't have any dynamic data.
