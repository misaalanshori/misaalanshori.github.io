Hello! Welcome to my blog thing. Not sure what I'm going to do with it, but I think I'm gonna be making posts about some cool projects I'm working on and also posts about some of my older projects.

First thing you should check out is this [blog post](/posts/001-nextjs-github-pages-actions) I made about this website. It also includes how I made this blog website and I think its really cool, and might give you some inspiration!
